Subject: UCM Cloud API Authentication Failure - Challenge Endpoint Returns "Invalid parameters!"

Dear Grandstream Technical Support,

We are experiencing an issue with our cloud-hosted UCM API authentication and need your assistance.

ISSUE:
The /api/challenge endpoint at our UCM (071ffb.c.myucm.cloud:8443) returns:
{"response": {"error_msg": "Invalid parameters!"}, "status": -1}

This prevents us from obtaining the challenge token required for authentication.

WHAT WE'VE TESTED:
- Both Python and Node.js implementations
- GET and POST methods with various payloads
- Different usernames (admin1, cdrapi)
- All request formats (JSON, form data, query params)
Result: All methods fail with the same "Invalid parameters!" error

VERIFICATION NEEDED:
Could you please verify these settings in our UCM (System Settings → API):
□ Enable API Access - enabled?
□ Enable Challenge/Response Authentication - enabled?
□ Allow RECAPI (Recording API) - enabled?
□ Allow CDRAPI (CDR API) - enabled?
□ API user configured with proper permissions?

QUESTIONS:
1. Does cloud UCM (*.c.myucm.cloud) have different API requirements than on-premise?
2. Is there an API key or additional authentication required?
3. What is our UCM firmware version and where can we find the correct API docs?
4. Are there any known issues with the /api/challenge endpoint?

USE CASE:
We're building AudiaPro, an AI call analytics platform that needs to:
- Receive CDR data via webhook ✅
- Download recordings via RECAPI ❌ BLOCKED

We have completed all development except recording downloads, which requires working API access.

CODE SAMPLE (Python - following official documentation):
```python
import requests
response = requests.get(
    "https://071ffb.c.myucm.cloud:8443/api/challenge",
    verify=False
)
print(response.json())
# Expected: {"challenge": "1234567890123456"}
# Actual: {"response": {"error_msg": "Invalid parameters!"}, "status": -1}
```

URGENCY: High - blocking production deployment

Please advise on proper API configuration or alternative authentication method for cloud UCM.

Thank you for your prompt assistance.
